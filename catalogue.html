    <p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>
    <p>"To start with, I bought this card for about 120k. Admittedly. he is not that expensive, but his stats do not do his price justice. His 99 pace, 95 shooting, 93 dribbling, and 93 physical are incredible. On the pitch, he can hold back any defender, make crazy runs behind the defender, and even perform absurd skill moves. His drawbacks, though, include his terrible passing and defending. Whenever I tried to through ball to my second striker, the ball would always be intercepted by the defender. And his small stature accounts for his terrible defending. - FutReviews"</p>
